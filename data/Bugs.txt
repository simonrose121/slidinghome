Level 12 cant be complete until the new switch mechanic is changed
Level 7 if the player slides on the first snow patch and then slide down, they cant get back up
Level 8 if the player slides on the first snow patch and then down, they slide stright over the first one to the next snowpatch, Also like level 7 they can't slide back up on the third patch
Level 5 has the same problem with the second snowpatch
Level 6 same problem with the second patch and thrid if they slide left then right it completes the game
Problem with star on levels, if the player completes any of the bottom row of levels (9,10,11,12) then it put the start above
